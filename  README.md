## Note
Some code was added just to show how "I can do", e.g. [CustomTestWatcher.class](src/main/java/base/CustomTestWatcher.java) or [User.class](src/main/java/base/User.java)

## Dependencies

- [Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/)  - to run tests 
- [Selenide](https://selenide.org/) - as wrapper for Selenium 
- [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) - for logging
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - to simplify obvious code, like getters, setters, constructor
- [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) - as library for assertions, mostly to make soft
 assertions easily. It needed for tracking failure if it is more than on assertion.
 Also it hase bunch of very useful assertions, like equals of Lists.

## How to run

To run tests you don't need to download anything, Selenide downloads chromedriver itself.


## Environment

Environment choose can be done in few ways, e.g. it can be stored in json files and configured by maven profiles

## Reporting

Currently reporting is generated by JUnit5 in [xml and txt](target/surefire-reports), with plugin converted to html, can be added as artifact each build in piplene.
Also it is possible to push reports in test management system, depends on system.
